# Automated Machine Learning Classification and Regression Application


Introducing an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) Classification and Regression App designed to streamline the machine learning workflow for both novices and experienced practitioners. This innovative application empowers users to effortlessly manage data, train models, and evaluate performanceâ€”all through an intuitive interface.




## Key Features


Upload Datasets: Support for CSV, Excel, or ZIP formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Automated insights such as data types, missing values, and descriptive statistics.

Handle Missing Values: Automatically remove columns with high missing data and impute remaining values based on column type.

Encoding Methods: Choose from Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, or Target Encoding for categorical columns.
Model Selection: Select between classification and regression models.

Supported Algorithms:

Classification: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM.

Regression: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Linear Regression, SVR.

Model Training Options:

Default settings or custom parameters.

Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

Performance Evaluation: Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (for classification), and MSE, MAE (for regression).

Test Data Predictions: Upload separate test datasets for further predictions.
